## Sulfur from acid neutralisation

Are you annoyed at having to go through the entire oil processing chain to get sulfur on
Vulcanus, when there is sulfuric acid just coming out of the ground? Do you crave another byproduct to throw into lava?

Then this is the mod for you! Now acid neutralisation also produces 25 sulfur (configurable). There is also
a recipe to simply vent excess steam into the atmosphere if you just want to maximize sulfur output.
